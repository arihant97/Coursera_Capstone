Toronto attracts a lot of people who leave their home town in search for jobs. It becomes difficult for the people as well as the lanlord to decide the right amount of rent/price for a house in a particular localilty. The price/rent of a house can vary depending on the amenities that are present in a particular locality. Different locality have different amenities and these amenities will help us cluster different localities and would help us in determining a basic price for houses in each locality.
